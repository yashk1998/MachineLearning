# Payer Analytics

A care management organisation called WeCare wants to identify among its diabetic patients, the ones that are at high risk of getting re-admitted to the hospital. They wish to intervene by providing some incentive to these patients that will help them improve their health. Objective is to identify high-risk diabetic patients through risk stratification. This will help the payer to decide what are the right intervention programs for these patients.
